# 👋 Hi, I'm Cesário Alves  
### Design Engineer • Frontend Architect • UI/UX Systems Thinker

I build **scalable, high-performance digital products** where  
design, code, data and automation work as a single system.

With 15+ years of experience, I specialise in turning complex flows into  
**intuitive, fast and production-ready interfaces**.

## 🧠 Core Mindset

- 🎯 Design → translated into real, maintainable code  
- ⚡ Performance → Core Web Vitals & UX metrics driven  
- 🧩 Systems → not pages, but scalable architectures  
- 🤖 AI-augmented development → faster & smarter workflows  
- 🔁 Automation → less repetition, more impact  

---

## 🤖 AI-Driven Workflow

I actively use AI to enhance product development and team velocity:

- **ChatGPT & Claude** → architecture, refactoring, problem solving, DX
- **AI-assisted UI implementation** → from design to production faster
- **n8n + AI** → workflow automation & smart integrations
- **Prompt engineering for frontend & design systems**
- **Code review & performance optimisation with AI**

AI is not a shortcut — it's a **force multiplier for quality and delivery speed**.
